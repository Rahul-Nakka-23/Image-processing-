# Image Processing - Convert Image to Grayscale

## Description
This repository contains a simple MATLAB script that reads an image, converts it to grayscale, and displays both the original and grayscale images side by side.

## Requirements
- MATLAB (R2015b or later recommended)
- Image Processing Toolbox (for `rgb2gray` function)

## Files
- `convertToGrayscale.m`: The MATLAB script that performs the image processing.

## Instructions
1. Ensure you have an image file (e.g., `your_image.jpg`) located in the same directory as the script, or provide the full path to the image in the script.
2. Run the script in MATLAB.
3. The original image and the converted grayscale image will be displayed in a side-by-side figure window.

## How to Use
- Replace `'your_image.jpg'` with the path to your image in the script.
- The script reads the image, converts it to grayscale using `rgb2gray`, and displays the results.
